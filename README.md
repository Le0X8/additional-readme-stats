# Additional README stats

Enhance your profile or repository README with these cool stats!

This project is compatible with and inspired by [Anurag Hazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra)'s [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) project.

**Note:** This project doesn't support gradients yet. Also, you cannot use the `width` parameter (and it will not be implemented soon).

## Platforms

- [Spotify](doc/spotify.md)

## Key encryption

You don't want to get your API keys stolen, right? That's why this project uses key encryption.
Every instance comes with a custom public key you can use to encrypt your keys.

You can encrypt your keys on a page I've created (needs JavaScript) [here](https://pages.leox.dev/armstats/key).

## Self hosting
